## ✨ What is *Vibe Coding*?

**Vibe coding** is the art of writing code that feels good — where functionality meets flow.  
It's about building scripts, tools, or automation that solve problems with simplicity and style,  
whether it's tracking packages, tweaking workflows, or just experimenting with ideas.

> It’s not just about code that *works* — it’s code that *feels right*.

### 🧠 Core Principles
- **Flow over fluff** – Practical, focused, and minimal.
- **Creativity meets utility** – Solving real problems in your own way.
- **Clean, readable code** – So future-you (and others) can vibe with it too.
